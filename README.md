# vnc_networks
Code to analyse the MANC connectome and perform connectome-constrained modelling

## Structure:
- `vnc_networks/` contains the main codebase
    It includes the follwing subdirectories:
    - the files defining the main classes to work with: Connections, Neurons, CMatrix
    - `vnc_networks/specific_neurons/`: code to analyse specific neurons
    - `vnc_networks/utils/`: utility functions
- `scripts/` contains the scripts to run the analysis
    - `examples/` contains examples of how to use the code
    - `generate_plots/` contains the scripts to generate the plots potentially used for the paper
- `data_dumps/` contains the data dumps used for the analysis
- `plots/` contains the plots generated by the scripts
- `preprocessing/` contains preprocessed data used for recurring analysis

## Description
The codebase is structured around the following classes:
- `Connections`: to load and manipulate the connectome
- `Neurons`: to load and manipulate the neurons
- `CMatrix`: to load and manipulate the connectivity matrix

The codebase is designed to be modular and flexible. It is possible to load the connectome and the neurons, and then perform any analysis on them. 

The classes interact in the following manner:
`Connections` loads the connectome and provides methods to extract the connectivity matrix. The connections between neurons can be modified by 
providing a list of subdivided `Neurons` objects or a list of neurons that are not connected together. An example use case is the split a neuron into subparts
restricted to a specific region of the connectome. 
It is possible to initialise a `CMatrix` object from the `Connections` object, by
providing an adjacency matrix and the ids of the neurons corresponding to the rows and columns of the matrix.

Note on neuron ids: the neuron `bodyids` are the same as the ones used in the connectome. Given that we can subset or split neurons, the neuron ids are 
remapped to unique ids named `uid`. The `uid` is used to index the neurons in the `CMatrix` object.
